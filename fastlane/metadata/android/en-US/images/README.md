# Feature Graphic Placeholder

This directory should contain a featureGraphic.png file with dimensions:
- Preferred: 1024x500 pixels
- Alternative: 512x250 pixels

The feature graphic is a landscape banner shown at the top of the app description in F-Droid.
It should be visually appealing and represent the app's functionality.

For UAD-Shizuku, consider creating a graphic that shows:
- The app logo
- Text indicating "Android Debloater & FOSS App Manager"
- Icons representing debloating, scanning, and app installation
